## About
A Simple Weather Application is a project that is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Through this project, I have learned how to consume an API provided by Open Weather.

## Links
Here are the links :
- [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/)
- [Undraw Open Source illustrations](https://undraw.co/)

## Demo

## Warning
Don't forget to change the Open Weather Api in file main.js on line 2 :

```javascript
const apiKey = "Your API Key";
```
